  <h1>A little sage advice</h1>
  <p>There's a lot of information out there about how best to grow annuals and perennials in one's garden. I have found varying results depending on the:</p><ul>
    <li>plant variety;</li>
    <li>watering amount; and</li>
    <li>sun exposure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I have found through trial and error that not all the growing instructions that come on the pot are necessarily accurate. If you are following the directions for the type of plant and it isn't thriving, try changing it's growing conditions and see if its change in environment improves its growing potential!</p>
