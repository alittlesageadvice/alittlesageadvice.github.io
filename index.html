  <h1>A little sage advice</h1>
  <p>There's a lot of information out there about how best to grow annuals and perennials in one's garden. I have found varying results depending on the:</p><ul>
    <li>plant variety;</li>
    <li>soil type;</li>
    <li>watering amount; and</li>
    <li>sun exposure.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>How to choose the right soil</h2>
  <p>When it comes to soil, one of the most important aspects is drainage. Make sure you are using garden soil with moisture control mediums, such as peat moss or perlite. One of the best soils you can buy is <a href= "https://miraclegro.com/en-us/shop/soils/miracle-gro-moisture-control-potting-mix/miracle-gro-moisture-control-potting-mix.html">Miracle-Gro's Moisture Control Potting Mix</a>. Even if you have the right growing conditions when it comes to watering and sun exposure, if you don't have the right soil, your plants will suffer.</p>

  <h3>Continue to grow your knowledge</h3>
  <p>I have found through trial and error that not all the growing instructions that come on the pot are necessarily accurate. If you are following the directions for the type of plant and it isn't thriving, try changing it's growing conditions and see if its change in environment improves its growing potential!</p>
